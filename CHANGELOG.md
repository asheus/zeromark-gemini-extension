# Changelog

All notable changes to this extension are recorded here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-25

### Added

- `get_taste`: what the reader decided, one save at a time (kept and let go per field and per voice, what they let go lately, and the claims their notes dropped, with dates). Nothing a model inferred; it says when there are too few decisions to call it taste.
- `get_map`: the Map's fields with the reader's keep rate, the saves in different fields that share rare ideas, and the notes they pinned together.
- `get_podcast`: the latest saves podcast as text, with a link to listen.
- Every save says who decided it (`decided.by`): only the reader's own Done and Let go count as taste.

### Changed

- `GEMINI.md` leads with the reader's decisions, says how many an answer rests on, and never recommends back what they let go without saying so.
- `weekly_question` is described as a suggestion: the reader decides.
- README, banner and descriptions say what the connector is for: other connectors give your AI what you saved; ZeroMark gives it what you decided.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-25

### Added

- The `zeromark` extension, connecting Gemini CLI to `https://www.zeromark.io/api/mcp` with OAuth sign-in.
- Eight read-only tools: `library_overview`, `search_saves`, `get_save`, `list_by_stage`, `get_memory`, `weekly_question`, `search` and `fetch`.
- `GEMINI.md`, which tells Gemini which tool fits which question and how to cite saves.
